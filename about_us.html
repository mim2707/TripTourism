                    <h5>History of Uzbekistan</h5>
                </div>
                <div class="panel_2">
                    <p> As East Asian countries began to develop its silk trade with the West, Persian cities took
                        advantage of this commerce by becoming centres of trade. Using an extensive network of
                        cities and rural settlements in the province of Transoxiana, and further east in what is
                        today
                        China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Sogdian intermediaries became the wealthiest
                        of
                        these
                        Iranian merchants. As a result of this trade on what became known as the Silk Route, Bukhara
                        and Samarkand eventually became extremely wealthy cities, and at times Transoxiana
                        (Mawarannahr)
                        was one of the most influential and powerful Persian provinces of antiquity.
                        In the eighth century, Transoxiana, the territory between the Amudarya and Syrdarya rivers,
                        was conquered by the Arabs (Qutayba ibn Muslim) becoming a focal point soon after of the
                        Islamic
                        Golden Age.</p>
                    <p>On 20 June 1990, Uzbekistan declared its state sovereignty. On 31 August 1991, Uzbekistan
                        declared
                        independence after the failed coup attempt in Moscow. 1 September was proclaimed the
                        National
                        Independence Day. The Soviet Union was dissolved on 26 December of that year. Islam Karimov,
                        previously
                        first secretary of the Communist Party of Uzbekistan since 1989, was elected president of
                        the
                        Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic in 1990. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, he
                        was
                        elected president of independent Uzbekistan. President Islam Karimov, the authoritative
                        ruler of Uzbekistan since independence, died on 2 September 2016. He was replaced by his
                        long-time Prime Minister, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, on 14 December of the same year. On 6 November
                        2021, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev was sworn into his second term in office, after gaining a
                        landslide victory in presidential election.</p>

                    <h5>Economy of Uzbekistan</h5>
                </div>
                <div class="panel_2">
                    <p> Since independence, the economy of Uzbekistan continues to exist as a Soviet-style command
                        economy, with a slow transformation to a market economy. The progress of governmental
                        economic policy reforms has been cautious, but cumulatively Uzbekistan has shown respectable
                        achievements. Its restrictive trade regime and generally interventionist policies continue
                        to have a negative effect on the economy. Substantial structural reform is needed,
                        particularly in these areas: improving the investment climate for foreign investors,
                        strengthening the banking system, and freeing the agricultural sector from state control.
                        Remaining restrictions on currency conversion capacity and other government measures to
                        control economic activity, including the implementation of severe import restrictions and
                        sporadic closures of Uzbekistan's borders with neighboring Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and
                        Tajikistan have led international lending organizations to suspend or scale back credits.
                    </p>

                    <p>Working closely with the IMF, the government has made considerable progress in reducing
                        inflation and the budget deficit. The national currency was made convertible in 2003 as part
                        of the IMF-engineered stabilization program, although some administrative restrictions
                        remain. The agriculture and manufacturing industries contribute equally to the economy, each
                        accounting for about one-quarter of the GDP. Uzbekistan is a major producer and exporter
                        of cotton, although the importance of this commodity has declined significantly since the
                        country achieved independence. Uzbekistan is also a big producer of gold, with the
                        largest open-pit gold mine in the world. The country has substantial deposits of silver,
                        strategic minerals, gas, and oil.</p>

                <div class="panel_2">
                    <p> Uzbek cuisine shares the culinary traditions of peoples across Central Asia. There is a
                        great
                        deal of grain farming in Uzbekistan, so breads and noodles are of importance, and Uzbek
                        cuisine
                        has been characterized as "noodle-rich". Mutton is a popular variety of meat due to the
                        abundance of sheep in the country and it is a part of various Uzbek dishes.</p>

                    <p>Uzbekistan's signature dish is palov (plov or osh or palov, "pilaf"), a main course typically
                        made with rice, pieces of meat, grated carrots and onions. It is usually cooked in a kazan
                        (or
                        deghi) over an open fire; chickpeas, raisins, barberries, or fruit may be added for
                        variation.
                        Although often prepared at home for family and guests by the head of household or the
                        housewife,
                        palov is made on special occasions by the oshpaz, or the osh master chef, who cooks the
                        national
                        dish over an open flame, sometimes serving up to 1,000 people from a single cauldron on
                        holidays
                        or occasions such as weddings. Nahor oshi, or "morning plov", is served in the early morning
                        (between 6 and 9 am) to large gatherings of guests, typically as part of an ongoing wedding
                        celebration.</p>

                    <p>Other notable national dishes include: shurpa (shurva or shorva), a soup made of large pieces
                        of
                        fatty meat (usually mutton) and fresh vegetables; norin and lagman, noodle-based dishes that
                        may
                        be served as a soup or a main course; manti (also called qasqoni), chuchvara, and somsa,
                        stuffed
                        pockets of dough served as an appetizer or a main course; dimlama (a meat and vegetable
                        stew)
                        and various kebabs, usually served as a main course.</p>

                    <p>Green tea is the national hot beverage taken throughout the day; teahouses (chaikhanas) are
                        of
                        cultural importance. Black tea is preferred in Tashkent. Both are typically taken without
                        milk
                        or sugar. Tea always accompanies a meal, but it is also a drink of hospitality,
                        automatically
                        offered green or black to every guest. Ayran, a chilled yogurt drink, is popular in the
                        summer.
